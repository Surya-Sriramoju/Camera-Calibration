# Camera-Calibration

## Problem 1
### Libraries used
- numpy
Calculates the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the camera and computes the reprojection error
* Enter into the directory
* In the terminal execute python problem_1.py

## Problem 2
### Libraries used
- numpy
- opencv
- glob

Computes the camera intrinsic matrix using opencv library and computes the reprojection errors for each image
* Enter into the directory
* Make sure you have the folder containing 'Calibration_Imgs' with exact name
* In the terminal execute python problem_2.py
